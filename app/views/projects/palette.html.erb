Here is what you can do next. You can browse the existing palette to attach to your project (if you haven't already) or else create a new palette for the project.

<%= link_to "Explore", palettes_path %> - <%= link_to "Create", new_palette_path %> palette.

Note: To attach a palette, go to project -> edit and choose from existing palette there.
